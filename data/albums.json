Deep in me, insulting Talking shit, pushing me Cold Cold Inside lying deep, the father of hate The endless nightmare I can never escape The broken in flames, they call out my name They dance in my dreams while I scream out in pain I'm on my way, this is the day This is the time to break it down Get out my way, nothing can stay This is the time to break it down Alone, awake with the craving I watch my step, I'm calculating On how I'm taking this motherfucker down, down, down, down, down I don't know what I am thinking Sometimes I feel like I am sinking Into the ground I'll call my grave Cold Inside lying deep, the father of hate The endless nightmare I can never escape I'm on my way, this is the day This is the time to break it down Get out my way, nothing can stay This is the time to break it down Break it down Deep in me, insulting Talking shit, pushing me I'm on my way, this is the day This is the time to break it down Get out my way, nothing can stay This is the time to break it down I'm on my way, this is the day This is the time to break it down Get out my way, nothing can stay This is the time to break it down They come for me, discomforting They make me feel like I'm one step away From doing it, I'm through with it I can't do it, suffer, can't get through it They come for me, discomforting They make me feel like I'm one step away From doing it, I'm through with it I can't do it, suffer, can't get through it"
